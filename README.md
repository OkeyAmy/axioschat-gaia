## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Information Flow

AxiosChat employs a sophisticated dual-model AI architecture:

1. **Conversational LLM (OpenAI)**: Manages the primary user interaction, understands intent, and determines if a Web3-specific action is required.
2. **Specialized Web3 AI Model (Flock)**: If a Web3 action is needed, this model interprets the request to identify the precise blockchain function and its parameters.

This system intelligently differentiates between:
* **Read-only operations** (e.g., checking a token balance), which can be executed quickly.
* **State-changing operations** (e.g., sending tokens), which are routed to a secure transaction queue for explicit user approval.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OkeyAmy/Axioschat.git
   cd Axioschat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *This will install all required packages including UI enhancements like `framer-motion`, `react-syntax-highlighter`, and `date-fns`.*

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your API keys:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   REACT_APP_REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key
   REACT_APP_GAIA_API_KEY=your_gaia_api_key
   # Add other variables as needed
   ```

   **Getting a Gaia API Key:**
   - For testing, you can use Gaia's public endpoint with the default API key:
     ```
     API endpoint: https://llama70b.gaia.domains/v1
     API Key: gaia
     ```
   - For production use, visit [Gaia's website](https://www.gaianet.ai/) to create an account and obtain a dedicated API key
   - Alternatively, you can [run your own Gaia node](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node) for complete control and customization

## üß† Self-Hosting Qwen LLM via Gaia Node

For users who prefer to run the Qwen LLM locally rather than using public API endpoints, AxiosChat supports integration with self-hosted Gaia nodes. This approach provides enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and complete control over your AI model.

### Setting Up Your Gaia Node with Qwen LLM

1. **Install the Gaia Node Software**:
   ```bash
   curl -sSfL 'https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/gaianet-node/releases/latest/download/install.sh' | bash
   ```
   Follow the on-screen prompts to complete installation.

2. **Configure for Qwen LLM**:
   Update your node configuration to use Qwen LLM:
   ```bash
   gaianet config --chat-url "https://huggingface.co/gaianet/qwen3-8b-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen3-8b-Q5_K_M.gguf"
   gaianet config --prompt-template "qwen3"
   ```

3. **Initialize and Start Your Node**:
   ```bash
   gaianet init
   gaianet start
   ```
   
4. **Connect AxiosChat to Your Local Node**:
   After starting your node, it will display a URL in the format:
   ```
   https://[node-id].gaia.domains/v1
   ```
   Add this URL to your `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GAIA_API_ENDPOINT=https://[node-id].gaia.domains/v1
   REACT_APP_GAIA_API_KEY=gaia
   ```

### Benefits of Self-Hosting

- **Privacy**: Your data remains within your infrastructure
- **Customization**: Fine-tune the model for your specific use cases
- **Reliability**: No dependence on external API availability
- **Cost-effective**: No usage-based API charges for high-volume applications

### System Requirements

To run Qwen LLM models effectively via a Gaia node, the following minimum specifications are recommended:

- **CPU**: 8+ cores
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum (32GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 20GB free space
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (optional but recommended for better performance)

For a complete guide to running specialized versions of Qwen (like Qwen Coder) or configuring advanced features, refer to the [Gaia documentation](https://docs.gaianet.ai/).

4. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8081` or another port if specified.

## üîÆ Future Roadmap & Vision

* **Phase 1 (Achieved & Enhanced)**: Core conversational AI, Web3 function calling, robust UI, secure transaction handling, support for Ethereum.
* **Phase 2**: Expansion to additional EVM chains (e.g., Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum) and popular L2s.
* **Phase 3**: Deeper DeFi integrations (e.g., interacting with specific lending protocols, yield aggregators via natural language), NFT management.
* **Phase 4**: Browser extension for in-context Web3 assistance and a dedicated mobile application.
* **Phase 5**: Advanced learning path system with customized, interactive tutorials based on user knowledge level and interests.
